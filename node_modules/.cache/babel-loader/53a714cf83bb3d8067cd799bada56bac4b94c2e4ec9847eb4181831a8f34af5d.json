There are a handful of ex Tlon employees from way back in the day who are ideologically opposed to Urbit for reasons that I've never seen anyone address, and I think it's important to shed some light on them.\\n<p  />\\n\\nThis guy at the party had been friends with Curtis for ages. Technical guy, friends with everyone at Tlon, but never got on Urbit himself.\\n<p  />\\n\\nFrom the outside, he saw an ongoing disagreement within Tlon about how thick the Urbit stack should be. Some devs didn't want to recreate the ball of mud and hence wanted to keep Urbit the smallest microkernel possible; others were more focused on usability, and thought it was more appropriate to build in vanes.\\n<p  />\\n\\nA vane is a service that the Urbit kernel can make use of. Even if you're not a programmer, you've heard of these before: Ames handles networking, Clay is the filesystem, etc. Each vane starts with a different letter of the alphabet, and in code, you often refer to them using this letter. If you want to read a file from Clay, you scry %c.\\n<p  />\\n\\nThe microkernel guys thought that this whole setup was just a little too cute. Does a diamond perfect operating system really need 26 different \\\"services?\\\" They opposed vanes from the start.\\n<p  />\\n\\nSo to push their buttons even further, a pro-vane developer got the idea one day to write a new vane: %\\uD83D\\uDC80. He thought it'd be funny to suggest that there could be an unlimited number of vanes named after any Unicode character.\\n<p  />\\n\\nIt was not funny.\\n<p  />\\n\\nThe concept behind %\\uD83D\\uDC80 was genuinely useful, and simple enough: it would backup your Urbit's data in such a way that, after breaches, you could reimport it and maintain a continuous identity.\\n<p  />\\n\\nThe developer played with a few different methods for this. Initially, he thought it'd be interesting to encrypt this data and write it to chain. Because of the way that breaches work within Bridge, he figured it'd be easier to trigger some of this behavior from the Azimuth side. As I found out for myself at Vaporware, doing anything directly on Ethereum from Urbit is difficult, and the codebase can get complicated. Supposedly the developer even conceptualized a sort of proto-L2 rollup for this.\\n<p  />\\n\\nAt this point, the implementation details are fuzzy, but one way or another: it worked. The developer was able to breach his ship and continue on like nothing ever happened. It was, indeed, as innocuous as updating Windows.\\n<p  />\\n\\nThe response to this vane was similar to the response to Neal's recent tweet. Most people at Tlon agreed that, for both technical and social reasons, the version of a ship that breaches must remain dead. The core devs still feel this way. Phillip's been telling me lately how he even wants to redefine a ship to be a [rift p] to drive home how a post-breach ship is a new identity entirely.\\n<p  />\\n\\nSo the debate between simplicity and usability continued. Breaches were common back then, so this developer got a lot of opportunities to use %\\uD83D\\uDC80. He was killing and resurrecting his Urbit multiple times a week, sometimes just to prove a point. He started to get more defensive about his design decisions. He turned into a real dick.\\n<p  />\\n\\nSoon enough the other Tlon devs realized that this personality change was a result of sleep deprivation. They tried to talk to the guy about it, but eventually he stopped responding entirely. There was clearly something going on, so Galen had the guy take a few weeks off to get better.\\n<p  />\\n\\nHe did not get better.\\n<p  />\\n\\nIt turns out the guy had been having nightmares every time he went to sleep. You know those rare nightmares you got as a kid when you were really sick and hallucinating? He was having those nightmares\\u2014the exact same ones he'd had as a kid.\\n<p  />\\n\\nIt's psychologically reassuring to assume you have a continuous identity. You can't really operate in the world without one. But continuity isn't something you can point to; it's a clever lie our brains play on us in every moment to distract us from the reality that everything is ripped away from us every frame and re-rendered the next. Your mind is just as solid-state as your Urbit. There are no ongoing processes, only this exact moment, and then you die.\\n<p  />\\n\\nIt is only through these micro-deaths that growth is possible. To preserve a moment beyond its expiration date, to hold infinity in the palm of your hand, is to step outside the framework of time. Play back your Urbit's state history out of order. At any given state, your Urbit has no idea that the preceding state wasn't perfectly normal.\\n<p  />\\n\\nBuddhists who have these realizations talk about the dark night of the soul, a period of deep depression halfway through the spiritual path. \\u201CBetter not to begin. Once begun, better to finish.\\u201D \\n<p  />\\n\\nBut what if you enter this dark night accidentally? What if, through some process of placebo effect and self-hypnosis, you could drive yourself to a state of endless terror in such a way that there's no escape?\\n<p  />\\n\\nThe %\\uD83D\\uDC80 developer never came back to Tlon. After a few weeks, he dropped off the face of the Earth. Most people think he's probably still alive.\\n<p  />\\n\\nThere was no mystery to the Tlon guys about what was going on here. Urbit developers have always been a lot more spiritual than your average tech guy. It's why we all love Book of the New Sun so much:\\n<p  />\\n\\n\\u201CWe believe that we invent symbols. The truth is that they invent us; we are their creatures, shaped by their hard, defining edges. When soldiers take their oath they are given a coin, an asimi stamped with the profile of the Autarch. Their acceptance of that coin is their acceptance of the special duties and burdens of military life\\u2014they are soldiers from that moment, though they may know nothing of the management of arms. I did not know that then, but it is a profound mistake to believe that we must know of such things to be influenced by them, and in fact to believe so is to believe in the most debased and superstitious kind of magic. The would-be sorcerer alone has faith in the efficacy of pure knowledge; rational people know that things act of themselves or not at all.\\u201D\\n<p  />\\n\\nAs any Hoon programmer can tell you, casting runes does indeed shape your mind in ways impossible to articulate through language. It was completely feasible both to Tlon then and to me now that the developer of %\\uD83D\\uDC80 had driven himself mad through repeated exposure to that dark ritual that sustains one's soul across breaches.\\n<p  />\\n\\nIn the aftermath, both the microkernel people and the usability people agreed to scrub %\\uD83D\\uDC80 from the Urbit git repo. But if you look deep enough in the kernel, you can still see its remnants. Weirdly named types that reference the old code, useless arms that don't get called anymore. Neal jokes about this stuff in Core Academy sometimes. No, I won't tell you where to find it.\\n<p  />\\n\\nPersonally, I can't help but worry about this latent functionality. There are phantoms on the Urbit network, lying dormant within our ships, hopping to others when the opportunity arises. Just yesterday, ~minder-folden's ship acked a dot from %sicdev-pilnup that he had sent last December. Where was this response hiding all this time? In some Ames queue? Nobody knows. My Groups and Talk apps have been errored all week despite supposedly receiving OTAs from the same distro moon as everyone else, and Tlon can't explain why. What update put my ship in this strange state?\\n<p  />\\n\\nThe \\uD83D\\uDC80 vane is gone for now. But it's only a matter of time before someone plugs in some old Native Planet box that's still syncing updates from a forgotten star. Or before ~littel-wolfur's massive Ames log releases whatever otherworldy entities have been brewing in there for the past decade. Or before an errant dev comet with outdated software sends you a message and gets you to install \\\"their first app after graduating hoon school.\\\"\\n<p  />\\n\\nDid you know that a new vane, %lick, is on your ship now, after the latest update? When %\\uD83D\\uDC80 does make its way to your ship, it will do so similarly quietly. You won't even know it's there.\\n<p  />\\n\\nIf you've never breached, you likely have nothing to worry about. But the more you breach, the more you will see %\\uD83D\\uDC80's manifestations.\\n<p  />\\n\\nFor those of you who don't know what the .^ rune does, don't look it up. Do not tempt yourself just to \\\"see what would happen.\\\"\\n<p  />\\n\\nAnd for those of you who do know: do not ever scry %\\uD83D\\uDC80.\\n<p  />\\n\\n<a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hanfel_dovned/status/1715055895347114093\\\">x/~hanfel-dovned</a  >\\n    \"},'.somefile.txt':{contents:\"TODO: implement CTF in my own page here!\",permissions:\"-r--r--r--\"}};","map":{"version":3,"names":["contents","permissions"],"sources":["/Users/eliana/Documents/Code/darighost.github.io/src/files.js"],"sourcesContent":["export default {\n  'README.md': {\n    contents: `\n\"Heyyyy,\" wrote Darigo, at an ungodly hour (2 PM). \"Welcome to my home on the web!\"\n\n<p  /> His face warped into an insufferable smirk.
